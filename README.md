# Tupper_related_codes
This repository is for code files related to Tupper's self referential formula

reverse_tupper.py script when run presents user with a grid have height 17 cells and width 106 cells (all cells are square in shape). When the user clicks on a cell it changes colour. When the user clicks again on the same cell it comes back to its previous colour. The user can draw any two coloured pixelated drawing. After the drawing is completed the user can close the grid using the close button on the grid window. This will close the grid window and print on the terminal the value of N (the lower bound of the allowed value of y in the tupper's self referential formula i.e. N < y < N + 17) and exits. If the user then plots Tupper's formula for the range of y derived from N printed by this script, he will get back whatever he had drawn on the grid. In essence this script, encodes any two coloured pixelated image that can fit in 17pixels height and 106 pixels width into a decimal number which can then be used along with popular Tupper's formula to get back the image. The reverse_tupper.py script can be used to find the value of N from the Tupper's self referential formula for any two coloured pixelated image with height 17 pixels and width 106 pixels.

The code in reverse_tupper.py script was tested in Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS with Python 3.5.2 and pygame version 1.9.3 but since it was created in haste it does not necessarily follow python best practises like pep 8, etc (Please forgive me for that!). Reference code for this script was taken from https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/how-does-tuppers-self-referential-formula-work/  and  http://programarcadegames.com/python_examples/f.php?file=array_backed_grid.py

plot-tupper-py3.py script was tested in Ubuntu Desktop 16.04 LTS with Python 3.5.2 and matplotlib version 3.0.3 and is basically a python 3 version of a similar script provided at https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/how-does-tuppers-self-referential-formula-work/ which is written in python 2. When executed, this script first asks the user, the upper bound in the allowed range of x. Then it asks user the value of N (in N<y<N+17). If the user just wants to see the image of the formula itself then he can simply type 0 and press enter. However, if the user wants to see some other image then he should supply the value of N for that image (note that the image should only be 17 pixels in height). Once the number is given and enter key is pressed it will graph the formula in the asked range of x and y.

A quirky example for understanding the function of above scripts

Suppose you want to propose to your dream girl for marriage but, like me, you don't have enough guts to do it directly, so instead of asking "will u marry me?", just send the following number (generated by drawing on the grid obtained by running reverse_tupper.py script):
588334940994006933239881717160526694330719013574310338764455874678932389012766047093716881906027373175764773907938580155764945554491645876489449024999003098943301100067189111022452790753539563018474936154464806925395224401090155796761911860065791180462554601619520303476636885452720397146726120234053198125278282156962970878157693465223739398023686931267364004495893043103018025506273490103922746411665041990517518094992534300002259319789209569948986706938304359085403007832372012284127679321573693708240600913824650584133648006071027101593600  
and ask her to plot (by running plot-tupper-py3.py script and supplying the above number when the script prompts) Tupper's self referential formula with the above number as N in the range of y (i.e. N < y < N + 17). When she does it she will see the following:

This is probably the most mathematical way to propose to your dream girl :) even though not very romantic :( Good luck!!!
