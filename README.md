# Tupper_related_codes
This repository is for code files related to Tupper's self referential formula

reverse_tupper.py file contains python code which when run presents user with a grid have height 17 cells and width 106 cells (all cells are square in shape). When the user clicks on a cell it changes colour. When the user clicks again on the same cell it comes back to its previous colour. The user can draw any two coloured pixelated drawing. After the drawing is completed the user can close the grid using the close button on the grid window. This will close the grid window and print on the terminal the value of N (the lower bound of the allowed value of y in the tupper's self referential formula i.e. N < y < N + 17) and exits. If the user then plots Tupper's formula for the range of y derived from N printed by this script, he will get back whatever he had drawn on the grid. In essence this script, encodes any two coloured pixelated image that can fit in 17pixels height and 106 pixels width into a decimal number which can then be used along with popular Tupper's formula to get back the image.
